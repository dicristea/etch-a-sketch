  > grid size, random rainbow & color mode, clear, delete

Tips:
- body {} automatically has margin: 8px, remember to set to 0
- Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1>h1</h1> & <h6>h6</h6> for headings and <p>for paragraphs.</p>
- cursor: pointer; on element
- body {font-size: 100%;}
- keep in mind what should be a global vs. local variable

To do in future:
- add ability to choose custom single color on color button click
- isn't 'innerHTML' not good practice? Keep trying to find alternate way
- be able to choose starting place, then click to begin etch-a-sketch
